    - download is IO heavy, not much calculation
        - use mandelbrot to measure calc-heavy workloads
        - for network, changing kernel buffer handler might speed up 2~3x
    - how many cores used? depends
    - use both strong and weak scaling to measure (need to make core count constant?)

    - tiny ML - ML on microprocessors
    - even if data is "bad" or "blurry", ok is ML can find pattern
    - do not use too much energy
        - loosely related: 粉末 computer
